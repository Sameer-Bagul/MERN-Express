### Web Server using Node JS

#### What is a Web Server?
- A web server is a software application that serves web pages to clients over the HTTP protocol.
- It listens for incoming requests from clients, processes those requests, and sends back the requested resources.
- Web servers can serve static content, dynamic content, or a combination of both.

#### use of nodemon
- `nodemon` is a tool that helps develop Node.js applications by automatically restarting the server when changes are detected in the code.
- It eliminates the need to manually stop and restart the server after making changes.
- To install `nodemon`, run `npm install -g nodemon`.
